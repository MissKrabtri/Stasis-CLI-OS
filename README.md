## Breakdown:

StasisCLI is an automation bot designed to help users purchase items, generate unlimited accounts and claim food deals.

## Why Open Source?

I work a full time job now, which I didnt when I initally launched StasisCLI. I unfortunately no longer have the time to continue to update StasisCLI, which is why I have decided to open source - allowing anyone to update what I have already built!
